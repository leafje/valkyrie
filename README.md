These are the core files for the rules and cards for the Valkyrie game I've been working on.

The cards are generated from the script in script.txt. You need to use [nanDECK](http://www.nand.it/nandeck/) to generate the PDF from the script file.

The rules are in a Word document, so I can do some minimal page layout.
