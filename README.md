# valkyrie
These are the core files for the rules and cards for the Valkyrie game I've been working on.

The cards are generated from the script in script.txt. You need to use [nanDECK](http://www.nand.it/nandeck/) to generate the PDF from the script file.

You are welcome to use small excerpts of the nanDECK script in your own scripts. I certainly benefited from numerous examples online. Attribution is appreciated but not required. You are not permitted, however, to copy the majority or the entirety of the script and make minor alterations, and redistribute it as your own work. 

The rules are in a Word document, so I can do some minimal page layout.
